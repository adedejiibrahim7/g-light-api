A PhP REST API package written for a mobile application

Digging through my PC and I found a the api package i had written for a mobile application some years back. It was for a mobile application that works to log electric power availability through user input. Users log on to the app to tell if there's power in their area, and also when it's taken, the admin having the responsibility of verifications and user rewards.
